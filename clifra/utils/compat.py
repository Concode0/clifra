"""Device compatibility shims.

Holds smart-dispatch wrappers for ops whose MPS kernels have broken
backward passes. Dispatch is resolved at import time so non-MPS
builds get the raw op as the same symbol — no per-call branch, no
Dynamo guard, no chance of a compile-time graph break from the
workaround path.
