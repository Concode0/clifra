## At a Glance

**Versor** provides geometrically structured layers — built on **Geometric Algebra versor** operations — that constrain spatial transformations to the rotation group where manifold structure matters, while composing naturally with standard linear algebra for channel mixing and readout. It supplies the building blocks for the **Geometric Blade Network (GBN)**: a hybrid architecture in which `CliffordLinear` (standard scalar weights) mixes channels, `RotorLayer` rotates multivectors geometrically, and `nn.Linear` handles task-specific projection.

**The Rotor Gadget** was implemented based on the theoretical framework of [Pence et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11688). In particular, the original authors' detailed experiments and implementations regarding LLM parameter efficiency can be found in the [official repository](https://github.com/vsingh-group/ComposingLinearLayers).

## Core Idea

Rotors ( $R = \exp(-B/2)$ ) perform pure geometric rotations via the sandwich product ($x \to R x \tilde{R}$), preserving manifold structure where standard weight matrices may inadvertently deform it.

In practice, GBN models are hybrid: `RotorLayer` / `MultiRotorLayer` handle geometric rotation, while `CliffordLinear` (traditional backend) and `nn.Linear` handle channel mixing and readout. The two approaches are complementary, not mutually exclusive.

## What's Built

- **Cl(p,q,r) kernel** with null dimension support for Projective GA
- **Signature-aware exp map** — closed-form elliptic/hyperbolic/parabolic (no Taylor series)
- **Hermitian metrics** for positive-definite inner products in any signature
- **Multi-Rotor GBN** with K weighted rotors (geometric spectral decomposition)
- **Rotor Gadget** — parameter-efficient linear replacement (~63% param reduction)
- **Automatic Metric Search** via GeodesicFlow + bivector energy analysis → (p,q,r) discovery
- **CGA embedding** Cl(n+1,1) for conformal geometric algebra
- **Riemannian Adam** optimizer — Adam momentum in the Lie algebra (bivector space)
- **Geometric activations** — GeometricGELU, GradeSwish, GeometricSquare
- **Rotor-to-symbolic-formula translation** — direct readout of trained weights as equations
- **Iterative geometric unbending** — 4-phase SR pipeline with blade rejection
- **ReflectionLayer** / Pin group — learns unit vectors, applies the odd versor `x' = -nxn⁻¹`; composable with `RotorLayer` for full Pin(p,q,r) group coverage
- **Algebraic completeness** — `clifford_conjugation`, `norm_sq`, `left_contraction`, `dual`, `versor_product` covering even and odd versor transformations in a unified interface
- **CliffordGraphConv** for molecular graphs
- **Bivector pruning** for geometric sparsity
- **GeometricTransformerBlock** with entropy-gated attention

## Quick Start

### Using Versor Layers in Your Own Model

```python
import torch
from core.runtime.algebra import CliffordAlgebra
from layers.primitives.rotor import RotorLayer
from layers.linear import CliffordLinear
from functional.activation import GeometricGELU

# Create a 3D Euclidean Clifford Algebra
algebra = CliffordAlgebra(p=3, q=0, device='cpu')

# Build a model with geometric layers
rotor = RotorLayer(algebra, channels=4)
linear = CliffordLinear(algebra, in_channels=4, out_channels=8)
activation = GeometricGELU(algebra, channels=8)

# Input: [Batch, Channels, 2^n] multivectors
x = torch.randn(32, 4, algebra.dim)
out = activation(linear(rotor(x)))
```

## Tasks

### Symbolic Regression (SR)

Discovers closed-form symbolic formulas from numerical data using iterative geometric unbending.

| Property     | Value                                                                        |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Algebra**  | $Cl(4,0)$                                                                    |
| **Pipeline** | probe → train → extract → subtract → refine (4 phases)                       |
| **Datasets** | [SRBench 2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03977) (first_principles, blackbox) |
| **Result**   | Median R² = 0.9525 on 15 First Principles equations                          |

**Analysis:** While the median R² of 0.9525 on First Principles equations is a decent result, this is still an early version of the SR pipeline. Much of the underlying logic can be further improved, and performance can be enhanced through parameter tuning — for example, by redefining the entry condition for implicit mode. The current version of SR should therefore be understood primarily as a **structural proposal**: a demonstration that iterative geometric unbending is a viable and interpretable framework for symbolic regression. The most important properties of this approach are **interpretability** (formulas are read directly from trained rotor weights) and **physically plausible structure** (rotor composition mirrors the composition of physical symmetries). The current implementation suffers from numerical instability and difficulty handling high-dimensional input data, both of which are planned for improvement in future versions.

**Speed-to-Performance Ratio**: For the 12 first_principles datasets, the entire execution took roughly 5 minutes (avg. ~23s per dataset). This demonstrates a structurally different efficiency from existing Genetic Algorithm-based SR models, proving that Geometric Unbending computes laws deterministically rather than searching for them stochastically.

### MD17 (Molecular Dynamics)

Multi-task energy + force prediction with conservative constraint ($F = -\nabla E$), using $Cl(3,0,1)$ PGA — translations are exact rotors, no approximation.

| Molecule      | Atoms | Epochs | VRAM  |  Time   | E MAE (kcal/mol) | F MAE (kcal/mol/Å) |
| :------------ | :---: | :----: | :---: | :-----: | :--------------: | :----------------: |
| benzene       |  12   |  400   | 11 GB | ~62 min |    **0.476**     |     **0.077**      |
| ethanol       |   9   |  500   | 6 GB  | ~52 min |    **0.613**     |     **0.079**      |
| malonaldehyde |   9   |  400   | 6 GB  | ~41 min |    **1.229**     |     **0.125**      |

All runs: rMD17 · 1000 train / 1000 val / 98 000 test · RTX Pro 4500.

![ERROR_DISTRIBUTION](assets/md17_prediction_benzene.png)


**Error distribution:** Across all three molecules, the prediction error distributions peak sharply at 0 and follow a Gaussian-like shape. This indicates the model is not making systematic biases — it finds the geometrically correct answer and the residual error is purely stochastic noise, consistent with a model that has learned the true underlying potential energy surface geometry.

```bash
uv run main.py task=md17
```

### LQA (Logical Query Answering)

A **geometric arithmetic logic device** (~228K params) that operates directly on frozen latent embeddings. Rather than building an end-to-end LLM, LQA isolates the question: *what can geometric algebra do to a latent space that flat linear algebra cannot?*

Each probe tests a specific algebraic operation — composition, asymmetry, negation — revealing both the power of the geometric approach and the hard ceiling imposed by flat embeddings.

| Property       | Value                                               |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Algebra**    | $Cl(4,1)$ Conformal GA                              |
| **Probes**     | chain (CLUTRR), entailment (HANS), negation (BoolQ) |
| **Chain**      | 100% accuracy at all lengths 1–13                   |
| **Negation**   | 64.6% — orig 65.2%, neg 63.9% (gap 1.3%)            |
| **Entailment** | 52.6% — ent 81.4%, non-ent 23.8%                    |

**Chain (composition):** Perfect 100% accuracy across all chain lengths 1–13. Rotor composition $R_1 R_2 \cdots R_k$ naturally represents multi-hop relational chains — the algebraic structure matches the task structure exactly.

**Negation & Entailment (encoder ceiling):** These probes deliberately expose the limits of flat embeddings. MiniLM maps "Is X?" and "Isn't X?" to cosine similarity 0.967 — the embedding shifts only 18% of inter-question distance under negation. An MLP baseline on the same embeddings achieves 59.5% (vs GBN 64.6%) with a comparable 1.0% negation gap, confirming the gap is bounded by the encoder, not the geometric model. The entailment probe shows a similar pattern: the HANS adversarial set exploits lexical overlap heuristics that MiniLM's flat space cannot distinguish from genuine entailment.

**Next step:** Replace the frozen MiniLM encoder with a geometric embedding pipeline, removing the flat-space bottleneck entirely.

```bash
uv run main.py task=lqa probe=chain training.epochs=50
uv run main.py task=lqa probe=negation training.epochs=10
uv run main.py task=lqa probe=entailment training.epochs=10
```



### DEAP EEG (Emotion Classification)

EEG emotion classification using phase-amplitude representation in Minkowski algebra with mother manifold alignment across subjects.

| Property       | Value                                                              |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Algebra**    | $Cl(3,1)$ Minkowski                                                |
| **Input**      | 32-channel EEG + 8 peripheral channels                             |
| **Targets**    | Valence, Arousal, Dominance, Liking                                |
| **Evaluation** | LOSO (cross-subject) and within-subject (80/20 split), 32 subjects |

```bash
uv run main.py task=deap_eeg training.epochs=10                          # within-subject
uv run main.py task=deap_eeg evaluation.mode=cross_subject training.epochs=10  # cross-subject
```

#### Results (32 subjects, 10 epochs, stride-applied windowing)

**Primary metric: RMSE** (labels normalized to [0,1]). F1 scores are omitted from the primary analysis due to label imbalance bias — valence and arousal predictions collapse to a single class at the 0.5 threshold, yielding F1=0.00 under cross-subject generalization. This is a known artifact of DEAP's skewed label distribution (most trials cluster above the neutral midpoint), not a model failure.

10 epochs is intentional — the model converges rapidly under stride-applied windowing (2280 windows/subject vs 600 in non-stride), and further training shows no meaningful improvement.

| Dimension     | Cross-subject RMSE | Within-subject RMSE |     Δ (cross − within)     |
| :------------ | :----------------: | :-----------------: | :------------------------: |
| **Valence**   |   0.2478 ± 0.055   |   0.2700 ± 0.086    | **−0.0222** (cross better) |
| **Arousal**   |   0.2438 ± 0.060   |   0.2243 ± 0.072    |          +0.0195           |
| **Dominance** |   0.2551 ± 0.073   |   0.1951 ± 0.062    |          +0.0600           |
| **Liking**    |   0.2839 ± 0.070   |   0.2423 ± 0.077    |          +0.0416           |
| **Mean**      |     **0.2576**     |     **0.2329**      |      +0.0247 (+9.6%)       |

**Key observation — the cross/within RMSE gap is remarkably small.**
The mean difference is only **0.025 RMSE units** (9.6% relative), despite cross-subject training using data from 31 other subjects and predicting a completely held-out subject. This suggests the Minkowski rotor representation captures subject-invariant affective structure: the manifold geometry of EEG phase-amplitude coupling is largely shared across individuals, and the rotor sandwich product preserves that topology under subject shift.

**Effect of stride-applied windowing:** Stride augmentation (3.8× more windows per subject) improves within-subject RMSE and F1 meaningfully — Dominance RMSE drops −0.017, mean F1 rises +0.029 — because the denser sampling provides richer temporal coverage of each subject's individual patterns. Cross-subject performance is essentially unchanged (+0.002 RMSE), which is informative: the cross-subject model already extracts population-level geometric features that are not sensitive to per-subject sample density. When stride helps within but not cross, it is evidence that the cross-subject model has reached a different kind of solution — one grounded in subject-invariant manifold structure rather than individual temporal statistics.

**Valence anomaly:** cross-subject RMSE (0.2478) is actually *lower* than within-subject (0.2700), a reversal of the usual pattern. This reflects the well-known DEAP valence difficulty — valence labels are highly inter-subject variable, so within-subject training can overfit to individual rating biases, whereas cross-subject training forces the model toward the more stable population-level valence manifold.

**F1 context:** Dominance and Liking show healthy F1 (0.70–0.76) in both modes because their label distributions are less skewed. Valence and arousal F1 collapses to near-zero under cross-subject evaluation, consistent with the class-imbalance literature on DEAP.

## Examples (Synthetic/Demo Tasks)

uv run python -m examples.main task=sanity
```

| Example        | Algebra   | Description                                             |

### Paper Counterparts (Synthetic Data)

Three well-known GA deep learning papers approached through Versor's composable primitives. These are **not reimplementations** — each paper has its own elegant construction. Instead, they demonstrate that Versor's general-purpose layers achieve the same algebraic guarantees (equivariance, invariance, field coupling) through different mechanisms. All run on **synthetic data** to verify structural properties, not benchmark accuracy.

```bash
uv run python -m examples.main task=gatr training.epochs=200
uv run python -m examples.main task=cgenn training.epochs=200
uv run python -m examples.main task=clifford_pde training.epochs=300
```

| Example          | Paper                                                              | Algebra         |  Original   |   Versor   | Synthetic Task                   | Property Verified                          |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| **GATr**         | [Brehmer et al., NeurIPS 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18415)   | $Cl(3,0,1)$ PGA | ~2500 lines | ~80 lines  | N-body spring dynamics           | E(3) equivariance (rotation + translation) |
| **CGENN**        | [Ruhe et al., NeurIPS 2023 Oral](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11141) | $Cl(3,0)$       | ~3000 lines | ~90 lines  | Point cloud invariant regression | O(3) invariance (rotation + reflection)    |
| **Clifford PDE** | [Brandstetter et al., ICLR 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04934) | $Cl(2,0)$       | ~4000 lines | ~120 lines | 2D Taylor-Green vortex           | Emergent vorticity in grade-2 bivector     |

How each counterpart relates to the original:

- **GATr** (architecturally close) — `ProjectiveEmbedding` + `GeometricTransformerBlock` follows GATr's structure. The main difference is *how* equivariant linear maps are constructed: GATr derives equivariant bases via representation theory; Versor's `CliffordLinear` operates on coefficients where the Cayley table enforces equivariance by construction.
- **CGENN** (same goal, different mechanism) — The paper proves that polynomial maps + hard grade projections = automatic equivariance. Versor achieves O(n) equivariance instead through composition of individually equivariant ops: `GeometricSquare` (faithful polynomial features) + `BladeSelector` (learned per-blade gates, generalizing hard grade projection) + `RotorLayer` (explicit group action, not in the original paper).
- **Clifford PDE** (equivalent factorization) — The paper's fused Clifford convolution kernel is factorized into spatial mixing (`nn.Conv2d`) + algebraic mixing (`CliffordLinear` + `RotorLayer`). The `RotorLayer` replaces the paper's Clifford Fourier transform for inter-field coupling. The model discovers vorticity (grade-2) without supervision — the same physical insight as the paper.
